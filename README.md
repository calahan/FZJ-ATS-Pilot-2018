# FZ-J-WWTP-ATS-Pilot  

Author: Dean Calahan

This repository contains code and data for creating cleaned data sets from the algal
turf scrubbing (ATS) pilot operated by Forschungszentrum-JÃ¼lich's (FZ-J) IBG-2/Alternative
Biomass department at FZ-J's campus wastewater treatment plant from August to October
2018 and from July-November 2018, and in the Novagreen Greenhouse from November-June 2019.

The input data comprises spreadsheets and csv files. These were copied from their locations on the FZ-J server K:\\Projekte\ATS\Data\WWTP Pilot\ to Research/. See the table for the file descriptions.

The code comprises `FZJAP2018.R`, a collection of functions for creating the data
sets, `Settings.R`, a collection of variable definitions used by the code, and `FZJAP2018Data.Rmd`.

Knit `FZJAP2018Data.Rmd` to clean the data and create the documentation.
