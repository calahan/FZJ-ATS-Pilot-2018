# Original Pilot
The Original Pilot (OP) ran at the final treatment tanks of the campus WWTP from August through November of 2018. It was then operated in the Novagreen greenhouse at the Algae Park until June of 2019, at which point it was moved back to the WWTP location. The floway length was extended in August of 2019, and the floway itself was divided into two narrower channels in order to perform controlled experiments, with one channel serving as a control and the other to test the treatment. The initial treatment selected is CO2 addition.
