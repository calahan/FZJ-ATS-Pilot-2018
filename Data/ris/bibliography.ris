AB  - Two Algal Turf Scrubber (ATS) units were deployed on the Great Wicomico River (GWR) for 22Êmonths to examine the role of substrate in increasing algal productivity and nutrient removal. The yearly mean productivity of flat ATS screens was 15.4 g á m-2ÊáÊd-1. This was elevated to 39.6ÊgÊáÊm-2ÊáÊd-1 with a three-dimensional (3-D) screen, and to 47.7ÊgÊáÊm-2ÊáÊd-1 by avoiding high summer harvest temperatures. These methods enhanced nutrient removal (N, P) in algal biomass by 3.5 times. Eighty-six algal taxa (Ochrophyta [diatoms], Chlorophyta [green algae], and Cyan-obacteria [blueÐgreen algae]) self-seeded from the GWR and demonstrated yearly cycling. Silica (SiO2) content of the algal biomass ranged from 30% to 50% of total biomass; phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon content of the total algal biomass ranged from 0.15% to 0.21%, 2.13% to 2.89%, and 20.0% to 25.7%, respectively. Carbohydrate content (at 10%Ð25% of AFDM) was dominated by glucose. Lipids (fatty acid methyl ester; FAMEs) ranged widely from 0.5% to 9% AFDM, with Omega-3 fatty acids a consistent component. Mathematical modeling of algal produ-ctivity as a function of temperature, light, and substrate showed a proportionality of 4:3:3, resp-ectively. Under landscape ATS operation, substrate manipulation provides a considerable opportunity to increase ATS productivity, water quality amelioration, and biomass coproduction for fertilizers, fermentation energy, and omega-3 products. Based on the 3-D prod-uctivity and algal chemical composition demonstrated, ATS systems used for nonpoint source water treat-ment can produce ethanol (butanol) at 5.8* per unit area of corn, and biodiesel at 12.0* per unit area of soy beans (agricultural production US).

AB  - Efforts to develop algae as a sustainable feedstock for the bioenergy economy have largely focused on cultivating microalgae for optimized lipid production. Because of this, filamentous algae are often overlooked in the algae biomass field because of their relatively low lipid content, although they do contain high levels convertible carbohydrates and proteins. Systems designed to produce filamentous biomass, such as algal turf scrubbers (ATS), have advantages over planktonic algae produced in raceway systems. Unlike raceway algae production, ATS systems do not require inoculum, nutrients, or CO2 inputs as these are readily obtained from the atmosphere or the natural waters feeding them. ATS systems are exceptional at removing nutrients from affected waterways. However, as a consequence of the growth environment (sand, silt and other suspended solids), and the composition of ATS biomass (diatoms), the periphytic biomass obtained from ATS can have very high ash, which represents non-convertible material that can complicate downstream conversion processes. We explored both physical and chemical approaches to remove ash with the goal of improving overall preprocessing costs and conversion yields while minimizing the loss of organic material. The simplest method for removing ash involved repeatedly rinsing the biomass with water at 25â€¯Â°C, which removed 34.5â€¯Â±â€¯3.4â€¯wt% of the ash with no appreciable loss in biomass. When treated with 2.0â€¯wt% NaOH at 80â€¯Â°C, up to 87.8â€¯Â±â€¯1.4â€¯wt% of ash was removed. These severe conditions, however, also resulted in organic material losses of 29.9â€¯Â±â€¯3.2â€¯wt%. Ultimately, these results will inform future tests, both chemical and mechanical, and will provide input for models that identify energy bottlenecks and potential savings.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study algal floway (AFW) to treat urban wastewater and to evaluate biomass productivity, lipid contents and biodiesel production. The results indicated the seasonal average algae productivity of 34.83â€¯g dry weight m2â€¯dâˆ’1 with a nutrient removal rate of 2.52â€¯gâ€¯m2â€¯dâˆ’1N and 1.25â€¯gâ€¯m2â€¯dâˆ’1P while the lipid content ranged between 14 and 22% of dry cell weight with the highest lipid productivity of 9.29â€¯gâ€¯mâˆ’2â€¯dâˆ’1 during summer. Biodiesel quality was superior during summer with high centane number and cold filter plugging point values. High eicosapentaenoic acid content was found during winter growth cycles. AFW algae community was dominated by pennate diatoms during all growing seasons. This study is one of its kinds in Indian wastewaters and it provides fundamental information for further optimization and use of AFW to treat domestic wastewater and to produce algae biofuel feedstock.

AB  - To optimize flow condition of algal turf scrubber (ATS) system for nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) removal at eutrophic waterbodies, we constructed two experimental scale (2.5â€¯m2) algal floways to test nutrient removal rates under various flow conditions via regulating flow rate and intermittent frequency of pump on/off. Results showed that the largest algal productivity and nutrient removal rate were generally obtained under the hydraulic loadings of 120â€¯Lâ€¯minâˆ’1â€¯mâˆ’1. Nutrient removal rate was high with an intermittent inflow 4â€¯hâˆ’1, followed by 12â€¯hâˆ’1 and 60â€¯hâˆ’1. We estimated that a hectare-scale floway system under a flow rate of 120â€¯Lâ€¯minâˆ’1â€¯mâˆ’1 and intermittent flow 4â€¯hâˆ’1 which would have satisfactory performance with affordable investment. This option has the greatest potential for the application of such technology in nutrient pollution abatement while producing bioresources from harvested microalgae.
